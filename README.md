Maze Solving Robot using 3 ultrasonic HC_SR04 sensors
################################################
Basic code for a wall following robot to solve a wall maze using 3 ultrasonic sensors HC SR04 (without PID controller)
###################################
This is an easy (not efficient) way to program your maze solving bot. It is based on depth first search where the bot prefers turning left for the progression of the search.  
The position of your sensors can affect the functioning and accuracy of the bot, key is to find that sweet spot for each one.
